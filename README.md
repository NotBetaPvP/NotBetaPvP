We now have a Patreon and a Liberapay. Proceeds go to our group and directly to what we do.

If you guys want a way to access the JS console (all ye tech-savvy folks out there), just drag this link into your bookmark bar. Don't click it! Drag me!

To use, just click on the newly created bookmark. A gray icon should pop up in the right down corner of whatever website you're on. Click it and you've got a JS console!
